Inter-Integrated Circuit aka I2C is a two-wire bidirectional connection used
for serial communication.

BAUD/second is how many bits are sent in one second.
9600 bauds/second = 1/9600 bits/second = 104 microseconds per bit
it's important that both devices are reading the same bit rate, otherwise the
device will be reading the bits incorrectly and will result in garbage data.

I2C needs two connections: SDA and SDL.
