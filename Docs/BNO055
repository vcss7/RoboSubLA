Adafruit is an intertia measurement unit (IMU).

Intro
=====
The BNO055 is a 9-Axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor. It uses three sensors for 3D space
orientation: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. It has a fourth sensor;
a thermometer.

What are the 9-Axis?
XYZ accelerometer   // Linear acceleration
XYZ Gyro            // Rotation acceleration
XYZ Magnetometer    // Strength of Magnetic Vector

What's the difference between an accelerometer and a gyro?

How to fuse the gyro and accelerometer data together to get better data?

How to make a compass to check what direction the IMU is spinning?

What are Euler angles? Understanding Euler angles.

Quaternions for solving the issue of being upside down.

setExtCrystalUse, what is the crystal? what does it matter? Why is the external
crystal more accurate?

Reading Data
============

3 sensors
    1. Accelorameter - measures forces being applied to the sensor.
    2. Gyroscope - determines orientation by using gravity.
    3. Magnetometer - measures magnetism.

Calibration
===========
Sensor must be calibrating for more accurate data. As is, the sensor reads
"good enough" data.
Magnets affect the calibration in the magnetometer.

Caibrate sensors
    Gyroscope - Let the BNO055 sit still for a couple of seconds.
    Magnetometer - Move sensor in a firgure 8, or wave it around.
    Accelorameter - Angle the accelorameter in different directions and hold
        each angle for a couple of seconds.

Issues
======
Problem: Euler angles has issues keeping absolute orientation when rotating more
    than 90 degrees. 
Proposal: Use Quaternions, which have less ambiguity, for the computing, and
    turn the Quaternions to Euler angles at the last second to interface with the
    PID controller and other part of the system.
