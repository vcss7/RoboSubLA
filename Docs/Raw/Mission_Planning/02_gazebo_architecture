gazebo tutorials
================
gazebo server
-------------
gazebo server is a command line tool that evaluates a sdl world file and simulates it. Pass a
world file_name path to the cli (can be relative to current directory, absolute path or
relative to a path in GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH).

  $ gzserver <world_filename>


gazebo client
-------------
gazebo client conencts to a running gzserver and visualizes the elements

  $ gzclient


server + graphical client in one
--------------------------------
use the gazebo command as a shorthand for running both a gzserver and a gzclient

  $ gazebo worlds/empty_sky.world


plugins
-------
a plugin can be specified in an sdf world file or in the command line (use the -s flag to
specify the plugin is a system plugin).

  $ gzserver -s <plugin_filename>

<plugin_filename> is the path to a shared library in the GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH variable.

gazebo architecture
-------------------
Gazebo provides two executable programs (commandline interfaces); one is to run the
simulation, gzserver, and the other is to interact with the simultion, gzclient.

Communication between processes
-------------------------------
Can be done with the publish/subscribe commmunication paradigm. Mainly, the gzserver provides a
simulated data, and the graphical user interface recieves and displays the data.
