Goal: Get the blastoise prototype loaded in gazebo.

[ ] Learn how to export blend file type to stl, dae or urdf file type.
[ ] Learn how thrusters work in uuvsimulator.
[ ] How to set up a thruster in uuv?
[ ] what shape do they need?
[ ] do they need a propellor?
[ ] Fix thruster placement
[ ] creating a robot model
[ ] look into xml file format


need to add stl/dae file to meshes in robot description
some sort structure t the robot description catkin package
what path do i need to add to insert a robot?


URDF is not a very flexible format; SDF creaeted to solve shortcoming of URDF
-> SDF >>>> URDF
SDF uses XML to describe the robot

Add URI to .sdf file in the robotest description package

How to load an sdf model in gazebo
add gazebo_ros as a dependency when creating a catkin package for the model

===================
gazebo components
-----------------
gazebo uses sdf(simulation description format) files to describe objects and world in a
simulation. At the highest level there are world files; using the .world extension. There are
also model files which are used to modularize smaller components of a simulation; these types
of files only contain one model description (i.e. <model> ... </model>)

gazebo uses enviroment variables which contain the location of various resources that will be
used in a simulation.

Environment variables:
  - GAZEBO_MODEL_PAT
  - GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH
  - GAZEBO_MASTER_URI
  - GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH
  - GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI

To modify these variables, first run the setup script for gazebo:
  
  $ source <install_path>/share/gazebo/setup.sh

then, modify the variables through export commands.
